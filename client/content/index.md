There were **10.2k** records published which are freely accessible by anyone. A total of **11.2mil** records were leaked, 10.2k was only **0.091%**...

Chances are 1 in 2 Aussies now has their **personal details and IDENTIFICATION details** leaked into some hackers' hands. Only God knows what they're gonna do with it.

This site is brought to you by an unhappy Optus ex-customer. I left them because I was unhappy with their service, and it didn't look like they'd leave me alone!
